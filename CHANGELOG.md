## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `--release` (`-r`) selects the TYPO3 version to install, now accepting a specific minor/patch release (e.g. `12.4.20`) in addition to a bare major version. Renamed from `--v`, which collided with the new `--version` flag.

### Changed

- Pinning an exact minor/patch release installs it with Composer's `--no-security-blocking`, since older patch releases are commonly flagged by Composer's security-advisory check. The script now prints a warning when this applies.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Initial release: one-command DDEV + Composer setup for TYPO3 11-14, with `--cleanup` and credential file generation.
